# We're stepping away from making cheats
Cheats on Roblox are considered bad because they give players an unfair advantage over others, ruining the competitive balance of games, creating a poor experience for legitimate players, and violating Roblox's community standards, which can lead to account bans, and therefore, we are working on creating anticheats for individual Roblox games. [Learn more about Ro AC](https://github.com/Robsploit/Soon/blob/main/README.md)

## Hi there, we're Robsploit üëã
